Addon related problems
======================

My addons have loading warnings!
################################

This is probably an issue caused by the way Windows's file system handles files that come
from different computers. Check the Addon DLL's properties by right-clicking the DLL,
clicking Properties, and checking if there's an Unblock checkbox next to the Advanced...
button.

If this checkbox is present, make sure it's checked, and hit OK to unblock the addon and
be able to use it again.
