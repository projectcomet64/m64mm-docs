Camera related Problems
=======================

I can only see the sky when starting up my game!

This is a bug that will be solved soon. You need to Unfreeze the camera, and apply
a favorite camera preset to bring back the camera to where it should be. This happens
because the game has frozen the camera when the level started, and Auto-Powercam did not
work properly.
