Floating Animations and the Levitate controls
=============================================

Some animations are made to be away from the ground, but it's hard to get them to look right. A way to be able to get them is to use a savestate with a greenscreen where the whole level is water, as done by fellow machinimist `Hammycheez <www.youtube.com/user/hammycheez>`_.

Another easier way is to use the Levitate controls in M64MM's Extra Controls. These will allow you to put an animation at a height higher than the ground.

 .. warning :: Some animations will be VERY bouncy at high levitation levels. Be careful!
 .. warning :: If you are in C-UP mode, you have to get out of C-UP mode first before you can see the changes in levitation.
 .. warning :: **Some animations don't rise when using the levitation!** Examples of these animations are animations like *"Flying (Wing Cap)"*
 .. note :: **Mario 64 Movie Maker 3**'s METAL Composer fixes some of the issues with certain animations stuck in the ground.
