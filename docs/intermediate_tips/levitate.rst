Floating Animations and the Levitate controls
=============================================

.. note:: The GIFs recorded here belong to M64MM2, but the text has been updated to
  accomodate to M64MM3.

Some animations are made to be away from the ground, but it's hard to get them to
look right. A way to be able to get them is to use a savestate with a greenscreen
where the whole level is water, as done by fellow machinimist
`Hammycheez <www.youtube.com/user/hammycheez>`_.

Another easier way is to use the Levitate controls in M64MM's Extra Controls.
These will allow you to put an animation at a height higher than the ground.

 .. warning :: Some animations will be VERY bouncy at high levitation levels. Be careful!
 .. warning :: If you are in C-UP mode, you have to get out of C-UP mode first before you can see the changes in levitation.
 .. warning :: **Some animations don't rise when using the levitation!** Examples of these animations are animations like *"Flying (Wing Cap)"*
 .. note :: METAL Composer fixes some of the issues with certain animations stuck in the ground.
